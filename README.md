# LabsoundCS111
"example1-audioToolkit" is a Problem set from my CS 111 course regarding sound manipulation. We were practicing loops and conditionals by altering songs in different ways. The Pset intrustions were specific in what was required of the output but the code itself was determined largely by the student. I had fun with this one! 

*I did not code imported files 'config' and 'waveTools'.
